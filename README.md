#  Title: A Signal Processing Study on Speech Enhancement for Hearing Aids

This project aims to investigate and implement speech enhancement algorithms specifically designed for hearing aids. Many hearing-impaired individuals face difficulties in understanding speech in noisy environments, such as crowded public spaces or busy offices. Traditional hearing aids amplify all sounds, which often leads to discomfort and limited speech intelligibility.

The goal of this project is to apply modern signal processing techniques to enhance the quality and intelligibility of speech for hearing aid users. By analyzing and comparing different speech enhancement approaches—such as Wiener filtering, spectral subtraction, and adaptive noise reduction—the project intends to identify methods that are both computationally efficient and effective in realistic auditory scenarios.

The outcome will be a MATLAB-based simulation that demonstrates improved speech clarity under noisy conditions, providing a foundation for further development in real-world hearing aid devices.
